# Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
# A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
# is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited tojust dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

# Solution: We can use a hash table to track the uniqueness of each characters.
# We also can use a stack to determine whether it is a palindrome.
# At the end, run a loop to each characters and apply two data structures mentioned above.
